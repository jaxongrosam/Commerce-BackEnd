# Commerce-BackEnd

## Description

Learning and understanding how models and routes work was the main motivation behind this project for me. It's a lot of content coming at us quickly, so I enjoyed working on setting up the models and the routes to get everything to work properly. 
This application would be useful for someone who is setting up a database for their store, but it doesn't go much deeper than that. 
I learned how to better navigate through code that's been given to me by someone else, and how to find reference data since there's so many files. Learning how to better set up CRUD functions is a very useful thing I learned as well.
